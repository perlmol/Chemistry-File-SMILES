Revision history for Perl extension Chemistry::File::SMILES

0.40  Wed Jun 16 2004
        - Added canonicalization (unique SMILES) and aromaticity support.

0.33  Thu Jun 10 2004
        - Added multiline support.

0.32  Mon May 31 2004
        - Changed the way disconnected structures are handled. Now "bonds" of 
          type . (dot) don't produce any bond in the molecule object (previous
          versions added a bond with order=0).

0.31  Tue May 18 2004
        - Added missing dependency on Chemistry-Mol-0.22 to Makefile.PL
        - Added support for a name after the SMILES string.

0.30  Mon May 17 2004
        - Added write_string (smiles output). Aromatic atoms and disconnected
          structures are still not properly implemented.

0.21  Mon Mar 1 2004
        - Distribution renamed to Chemistry::File::SMILES
        - Use Chemistry::File interface
        - Some changes in the way charges and h-counts are parsed;
          (e.g., now -- is converted to -1, H is converted to 1).

0.11  Mon Nov 3 2003
        - Now the default atom and bond handlers call new_atom and new_bond
            instead of creating the atom and bond themselves.
        - Fixed a POD error.

0.10  Fri Sep 6 2003
	- first release as Chemistry::Smiles
