        - Use Chemistry::File interface
        - Some changes in the way charges and h-counts are parsed;
          (e.g., now -- is converted to -1, H is converted to 1).

0.11  Mon Nov 3 2003
        - Now the default atom and bond handlers call new_atom and new_bond
            instead of creating the atom and bond themselves.
