Chemistry/File::SMILES version 0.40
===================================

This object-oriented module parses and produces SMILES (Simplified Molecular
Input Line Entry Specification) strings. It is a File I/O driver for the PerMol
Toolkit. 

For more information about SMILES, see The SMILES Home Page at
http://www.daylight.com/dayhtml/smiles/

Missing features:
* Branches that start before an atom, such as (OC)C, which should be 
  equivalent to C(CO) and COC, according to some variants of the SMILES 
  specification. Many other tools don't implement this rule either.

CHANGES SINCE VERSION 0.33
        - Added canonicalization (unique SMILES) and aromaticity support.
