Chemistry/File::SMILES version 0.33
===================================

This object-oriented module parses and produces SMILES (Simplified Molecular
Input Line Entry Specification) strings. It is a File I/O driver for the PerMol
Toolkit. 

For more information about SMILES, see The SMILES Home Page at
http://www.daylight.com/dayhtml/smiles/

This module is under development and doesn't implement the full SMILES syntax
yet.

Missing features:
* Branches that start before an atom, such as (OC)C, which should be 
  equivalent to C(CO) and COC, according to some variants of the SMILES 
  specification. Many other tools don't implement this rule either.
* Proper handling of aromatic atoms.
* Unique (canonical) SMILES output.

CHANGES SINCE VERSION 0.32
        - Added multiline support.
